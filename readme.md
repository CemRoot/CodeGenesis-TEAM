Note:
- Adjust file paths, names, and descriptions as your project evolves.
- The `.env` file typically contains secret credentials like database connection strings. Make sure not to commit secrets to version control in a public repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (or your chosen version)
- pip or conda for Python package management
- A local or remote MongoDB instance (if needed)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeGenesisTeam.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd CodeGenesisTeam
```

3. Install required packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or (if using conda):
```sh
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your environment variables in `.env` (e.g., `MONGO_URI`, `DATABASE_NAME`):
```dotenv
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.example.mongodb.net"
DATABASE_NAME="codegenesis_db"
```

## Usage
1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Open `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb` to get a quick look at the raw data.
2. **Data to MongoDB:**
   - Run `notebooks/02_data_to_mongo.ipynb` to load data into MongoDB.
3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Use `notebooks/03_data_cleaning.ipynb` for data preprocessing and cleaning steps.
4. **Analysis & Visualization:**
   - Explore `04_analysis.ipynb` and `05_visualization.ipynb` for key insights and charts.
5. **Final Report:**
   - All major findings and conclusions are compiled in `06_final_report.ipynb`.

## Data Explanation
- **Raw Datasets:** Located under `data/raw/`. These files are the original unaltered datasets.
- **Processed Data:** Located under `data/processed/`. Contains cleaned and merged datasets.

Refer to each `readme_for_*.md` file in `data/raw/` for detailed information on the specific datasets, their sources, and any usage caveats.
