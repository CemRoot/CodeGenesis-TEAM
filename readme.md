## üìñ Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination rates and mortality, focusing on both global
data and US-specific trends. Using advanced analytics and Python-based tools, the analysis aims to uncover key insights
and implications for public health policies. The study incorporates statistical analysis, machine learning, and dynamic
visualizations.

### Key Objectives:

- Analyze trends in death rates among unvaccinated, vaccinated without boosters, and bivalent booster groups in the US.
- Identify regional disparities in vaccine distribution and its impact on mortality globally.
- Examine correlations between vaccination rates and mortality using statistical and machine learning models.

## üß∞ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB (local or cloud-based instance)
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeGenesisTeam.git
    cd CodeGenesisTeam
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up MongoDB:**
    - Add your MongoDB credentials in `.env`:
    ```plaintext
    MONGO_URI="your_mongo_connection_uri"
    DATABASE_NAME="codegenesis_db"
    ```

4. **Load raw data into MongoDB:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/data_to_mongo.py
    ```

- Death rates declined with vaccination campaigns.
- Significant differences identified through ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Global Data Analysis

**Findings:**

- Strong negative correlation between vaccination rates and mortality.
- Regional disparities highlight unequal vaccine distribution.
